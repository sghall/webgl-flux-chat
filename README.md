## WebGL Flux Chat Demo

A hybrid app using FaceBook's "Flux" application architecture. The app uses [SubUnit](http://github.com/sghall/subunit) for WebGL views in THREE.js and [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) for the chat input view.

This project started as a fork of FaceBook's awesome demos of [flux](https://github.com/facebook/flux). 

Clone the repo and bower install.

### About the chat app demo from the FaceBook team...

This is an example application we've created to show an example of how a Flux
app is structured, and how you might use waitFor to make sure the Stores'
registered callbacks are called in the correct order.
